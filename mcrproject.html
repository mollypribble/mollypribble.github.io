        <p class = "project-text">Metacognitive behavior, the patterns in the ways we work and think (e.g. I tend to procrastinate my reading assignments, which means I am often rushed to finish  them and cannot properly digest the information from them), can be difficult to improve, even if we are aware of our shortcomings. These problematic behaviors can negatively impact the quality and efficiency of our work. These behaviors are particularly difficult to regulate for student-researchers who are leading their own projects due to the complex nature of their work and the large amount of feedback they can receive from mentor figures.</p>
        <p class = "project-text">Mindyoga is a system that aims to support student researchers in improving metacognitive behaviors through frequent reflection and through leveraging the support and resources of the studentâ€™s research community.</p>

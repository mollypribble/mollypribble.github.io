        <p class = "header-text">Initial Storyboards</p>
        <p class = "project-text">For this round of prototype testing, we began by storyboarding our user journeys based on our knowledge of the DTR social structure and our results from last user studies. We  determined that <b>using  mentor feedback as a way to leverage community knowledge</b> in our system would allow students to gain insight from more experienced researchers in ways they can improve their metacognitive processes. Additionally, we hypothesized that having a <b>retrospective reflection</b>, inspired by the practice of holding retros in agile/scrum working environments, would allow users to reflect on their metacognitive process and track any progress they made.</b></p>

        <p class = "header-text">Designing Research Questions</p>
        <p class = "project-text">This past quarter (spring 2021), we ran multiple user studies with our prototype to learn more about how our users utilize mentor feedback to ground their reflections. Specifically, we asked the following research questions:</p>
        <p class="standout-text"><b> 1 </b>- Since our reflections are grounded in mentor feedback, can users successfully categorize mentor feedback as metacognitive or non-metacognitive? <br><br><b> 2 </b>- Can users successfully interpret mentor feedback in a consistent manner with mentor intentions?</p>

      <div class = "text-center">
        <p class = "header-text">Practical Feedback vs. Metacognitive Feedback</p>
        <p class = "project-text">During our study we found that when asked 93% of students were able to categorize feedback as either metacognitive or non-metacognitive. However, we also found that this strict, binary categorization may have hindered students from identifying and interpreting metacognitive feedback, as by categorizing feedback as entirely non-metacognitive, it could prevent them from thinking of the implicit metacognitive feedback given within a broader, more practically-focused piece of feedback.</p>
        <p class="standout-text"><b>Major Finding 1</b> - A piece of feedback can have both metacognitive and practical elements. Our binary classification of feedback is not flexible enough to support students in parsing out implicit metacognitive feedback.</p>

        <p class = "header-text">Mentor Intention vs. Mentee Interpretation</p>
        <p class = "project-text">While conducting our study, we also saw instances of students misinterpreting metacognitive feedback. One instance was of a two-student team that received the feedback of "don't get blocked" during our study. This team interpreted "don't get blocked" as "work around that rather than find other ways to achieve the same goal." The next week, the mentor and the mentees had to spend some time during their weekly meeting to understand what the mentor's intention was by saying "don't get blocked" which they clarified to mean "if it doesn't happen, find someone else [to get help from]."</p>
        <p class="standout-text"><b>Major Finding 2</b> - Mentor intention behind giving specific pieces of feedback does not always match up with mentee interpretation of that feedback. Our system does not support students enough in determining the true meaning of mentor feedback, which can prevent them from improving their metacognitive practices in a way consistent with mentor intentions.</p>

        <p class = "header-text">Unifying Practical and Metacognitive Goals</p>
        <p class = "project-text">Based on our findings, we have developed the following design updates to our prototype to address the obstacles that are preventing users from effectively utilizing metacognitive reflection to improve their work processes. Our first main update is to connect practically-focused and metacognitively-focused feedback in a way that allows users to connect their metacognitive risks to their current project work. We plan on implementing a new model that ask users about their metacognitive risks, their practical risks, their metacognitive strategies for addressing these risks, and their practical strategies. This structure starts with them summarizing their mentor's feedback, without labeling it as metacognitive or non-metacognitive. Then we ask users to frame this feedback in a metacognitive way and a practical way to determine their metacognitive risks and strategies and their practical risks and strategies, respectively. Finally, we ask users to converge on a specific action item that uses elements of their metacognitive strategies and practical strategies to address risks both in their metacognitive process and their project. This design addresses the risks posed by delineating a strict distinction between metacognitive and non-metacognitive feedback by training users to pick out the implied metacognitive elements of all feedback, as opposed to ignoring feedback that seems, at the surface level, more practically-focused.</p>

        <p class = "header-text">Aligning Mentors and Mentees</p>
        <p class = "project-text">The second main feature we will introduce is a collaborative environment where both mentors and mentees can work together to interpret and clarify mentor feedback. This is beneficial not only for the mentees (so they can have a clearer understanding of the risks and strategies identified by their mentors), but also for the mentors (so they can gain more insight into their mentees' thought process and identify where the gaps in their coaching may be). This forum will allow mentors and mentees to resolve differences in understanding, and therefore help mentees practice in ways that are more consistent with mentor feedback.</p>

        <p class = "header-text">Next Steps</p>
        <p class = "project-text">Currently, our next steps for this project would be to test our new characteristics to see if they assist users in overcoming their existing obstacles. Additionally, we want to explore how to embed this system within the structure of DTR in a way that best leverages the different venues students have to receive feedback and practice their metacongitive strategies. These venues include SIG (a meeting between a mentor and their mentees), studio (a collaborative work session for all members of the DTR community), and project  team meetings (meetings between students co-leading a research project).</p>

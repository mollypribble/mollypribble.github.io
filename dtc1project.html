        <p class = "project-text">For this project, our goal was to create a device to assist an infant with hypotonia in doing their tummy time exercises. Our solution was the <b>Tummy Time Trianles</b>, a set of foam ramps that supported the infant during tummy time, provided engaging stimuli to encourage movement, and were small, easy-to-set-up, and repurposable.</p>

        <p class = "subtitle"><b>The Importance of Tummy Time</b></p>
        <p class = "project-text">Tummy time is important for infants to develop muscle tone. However, some infants have hypotonia, extremely low muscle tone that prevents them from engaging in these exercises at all. When this is the case, doctors recommend doing supported tummy time, where infants can do these exercises with an aid to better support themselves. Initially, our clients (the infant's parents), used a propped-up mattress to support their child during tummy time, which was bulky and inconveient to set up and use. </p>

This design is much smaller and easier to use than a large, bulky mattress and still provides the necessary support for the infant during tummy time.</p>

It consisted of a larger cushion to support their arms as well as a smaller cushion on the front to catch their head if they fell during tummy time. However, we enetually eliminated this design as it was less intuitive to use and was not as supportive as the ramp mockup.</p>

        <p class = "project-text">To keep the infant engaged and encourage movement during tummy time, we developed a removeable cover that provided both auditory and tactile stimuli for our user. Their parents indicated that they were very interested in sounds and soft materials. To encourage movement, we inserted a <b>piece of cellophane into the cover that would crinkle</b> when the user moved their body. Similarly, to encourage the infant to move their arms, we included <b>three felt squares on the outside of the cover</b> that they could reach out and feel during tummy time. <br><br> Additionally, we included three loops on the front edge of the cover for <b>easy attachment of their favorite clip-on toys and rattles</b>, things their parents say they use to keep their child engaged during tummy time.</p>

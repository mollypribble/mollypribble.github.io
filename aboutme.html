        <p class = "title">Hello, World.</p>
        <p class = "text">I'm Molly. </p>
        <p class = "text">Although I am not an extrovert, I am definitely a people person. I've always loved making and doing things for others, whether it was a crafting clay pot for my mom when I was in elementary school or advising other undergraduate students about navigating college life as a Peer Leader at my university. </p>
        <p class = "text">I've been lucky enough to be able to translate this interest to my experiences in and out of the classroom. Currently, I lead an HCI research project that aims to increase user's ability to regulate their metacognitive behaviors through self-reflection, where human-centered design plays large role in our research process. Additionally, I write for a weekly newsletter, Hold the Code, where I get to use my technical knowledge to break down topics in AI and CTech and discuss their ethical implications. While my academic background is mainly technical, I believe that technology should be designed to support people, not the other way around, and this platform gives me a voice to raise awareness of ethical concerns surrounding emerging and everyday technologies.</p>
        <p class = "text">I am currently pursuing a combined BS/MS in Computer Science and a certificate in Design at Northwestern University. When I'm not working on my research project or studying at the student center, you can find me practicing yoga, working on my drawing skills (I've been really into oil pastels recently), or reading books about linguistics. Whether you want to talk about design, linguistics, or AI ethics, I would love to hear from you.</p>

And it's really hard to stop.<br><br>In 2019, Kashmir Hill, then a reporter for Gizmodo, famously tried to block out five major tech companies - Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple - first individually, then all at once. Over the following weeks, she realized the true extent of how intertwined these companies are in our daily lives. Want to watch a new movie or listen to new music? Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify all rely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud to distribute their content. Want to push new updates to your Github repo? That's owned by Microsoft. <b>Not only are we creating massive amounts of data, but we are also generating massive paychecks for Big Tech.</b>"</p></a>

        <p class  = "project-text">As artificial intelligence (AI) technology becomes more a part of our everyday lives, it is important that everyone is able to undertand how it works, what it is doing, and what the potential impacts are. Currently, topics surrounding AI and contemporary technology are not always talked about enough, and when they are these discussions can exclude those without much technical knowledge due to confusing (and sometimes misleading) jargon.</p>
        <p class = "project-text">At Hold the Code, we breakdown these technical topics for our readers to increase awareness of these systems and their social, political, and ethical implications.</p>

              <p class = "story-project-text">"While it may seem trivial that our AI may not be able to correctly differentiate between a robin and a penguin, there can be serious consequences when image classification goes awry in more high-stakes scenarios. Image classification has many applications in medicine, as it is often used as a tool in diagnosing injuries and illnesses from X-Rays or CT scans. If these AIs have learned false correlations, the results can have major impacts by missing diagnoses or misdiagnosing patients. <b>Therefore, using a technique to identify faulty features can have many benefits in the application of image classification. </b>"</p></a>

AI is notorious for often containing bias in the ways they are implemented, trained, and applied. <b>Especially in education, it's imperative that these systems be built for all users, no matter their background or identity. </b>"</p></a>

              <p class = "story-project-text">"Every time you send an email, like a Tweet, or stream a new TV show, you are creating data. And it's really hard to stop. In 2019, Kashmir Hill, then a reporter for Gizmodo, famously tried to block out five major tech companies - Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple - first individually, then all at once. Over the following weeks, she realized the true extent of how intertwined these companies are in our daily lives. Want to watch a new movie or listen to new music? Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify all rely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud to distribute their content. Want to push new updates to your Github repo? That's owned by Microsoft. <b>Not only are we creating massive amounts of data, but we are also generating massive paychecks for Big Tech.</b>"</p></a>

        <p class  = "project-text">During my time serving as RAISO's newsletter executive (Oct 2021-June 2022), our team at Hold the Code reached a number of milestones, including:</p>
        <p class = "project-text"><b>1</b> - Increasing our newsletter's subscriber count by over 150% and our overall viewership by over 120% <br> <b>2</b> - Expanding Hold the Code to alternative forms of media (check out <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/raisogram/" target = "_blank"><mark>our Insta</mark></a> for some cool content!) <br> <b>3</b> - Seeing our team grow from 3 members to 8 <br> <b>4</b> - Publishing 23 new editions of our newsletter</p>
        <p class = "project-text">These achievements would not have been possible without my fellow committee members, the RAISO community, and support from the CS department at NU. I am immensely proud of and grateful for my time with Hold the Code as it has truly shaped how I understand, analyze, and (hopefully) will contribute to ethical technology in my career.</p>

        <p class = "project-text"><a href = "https://www.savemiheart.org" target = "_blank"><mark><em>SaveMiHeart</em></mark></a> is a nonprofit organization based in Michigan that aims to improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest in the community through research and education initiatives. This year they are virtually hosting their 6th annual conference covering bystander intervention and cardiac arrest survival after the COVID-19 pandemic.<br></p>
        <div class = "spacer-small"></div>

        <p class  = "project-text">My client also wanted the logo to represent what is called the <b>chain of survival</b> that depicts the  necessary steps needed to maximize chances of surviving cardiac arrest from bystander intervention to professional treatment to recovery. Additional inspiration was also taken from the EKG line that measures the heart rate of hospital patients. </p>

        <p class = "subtitle">Form & Function</p>
        <p class = "project-text">After discussion with my client, I learned that the logo would mainly be use as <b>a header for webpages, e-flyers, and emails</b>. Additionally, some of the conference moderators wanted to use it as <b>a Zoom background</b> during the event itself, since the entire conference was run virtually this year. This use case pointed towards a larger, horizontal layout that could be used as a banner at the top of conference advertisement and communications as well as a Zoom background.</p>

        <p class = "subtitle">Highlighting Bystander CPR</p>
        <p class = "project-text">Initial sketches were done by hand and digitally to iterate on potential designs  that conveyed the story of the chain of survival. Some of these sketches did not specifically include bystander CPR, a key step to improving cardiac arrest survival. </p>

        <p class = "standout-text">For every minute that passes without bystander CPR and AED intervention, a victim's chance of survival decreases by 10%.</p>
        <div class = "spacer-small"></div>
        <p class = "project-text">After getting feedback from my client and learning more about chances of survival with and without this step, I decided to add a pair of CPR hands to the logo and iterated on more designs from there.</p>

        <p class = "subtitle">Storytelling through Line Width</p>
        <p class  = "project-text">As the logo developed, I added more details, but didn't really feel as though the logo was conveying movement through the chain of survival. I looked back at SaveMiHeart's existing logo and branding and noticed the outline of Michigan had varying line widths and almost looked like a ribbon. It had more <b> dimension, movement, and fluidity, </b>and I wanted to capture that in their conference logo as well. I experimented with varying lines width and eventually converged on one style in particular.</p>
        <p class = "project-text">While the line is much thinner than the SaveMiHeart's original logo, the conference logo reminded me almost of a pen,<b> like someone was writing their story about how they survived sudden cardiac arrest.</b> One of the campaigns run by SaveMiHeart actually looks for and reports on survival stories from cardiac arrest victims. I felt that this line width almost represents those survivors telling their stories through SaveMiHeart.</p>

        <p class = "project-text">Below is the final version of the logo. It consisted of SaveMiHeart's logo text and the conference title arranged around a stylized EKG line depicting the chain of surviving sudden cardiac arrest. In addition to matching existing SaveMiHeart branding, this logo also successfully <b>depicts the story of the surviving sudden cardiac arrest</b> and also <b>provides an informative visualization of the chain of survival.</b></p>

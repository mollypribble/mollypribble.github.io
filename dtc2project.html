        <p class = "project-text">This project aimed to assist our user, who had cerebral-palsy, in putting a shirt on independently. While putting on a shirt is a complex movement, after our observations and interviews with our user, their parents, and their physical therapist, we noticed that <b>our user's leg instability is what prevented them from completing this task independently. </b><br><br>Therefore, we developed the <b>Balance Block</b>, an easy-to-use, comfortable stability aid to support our user as they put on a shirt independently.</p>

        <p class = "header-text"><b>Attaching the Block</b></p>
        <p class = "project-text">After developing the shape of the block, our next phase of prototyping surrounded how to hold the block in place. As this product would be used in a variety of environments, we decided we needed to stabilize the block to the user as opposed to another object (like a chair or their wheelchair) which may or may not be present at the time of use. Therefore, we prototyped a number of attachment methods that would <b>(1) hold the block in place </b>and<b> (2) be easy for the user to operate independently.</b></p>

                  <p class = "collage-title-text">The simplest attachment method involved two straps that would wrap around either leg. This attachment method was the easiest to operate, but lead to some slipping as the block tending to shift towards the user's knees with continued use. We eventually chose to use this attachment method due to its ease-of-use and develop an alterative solution to prevent this slipping.</p>

                  <p class = "collage-title-text">Another attachment method we tried was to use straps that wrapped under the user's body. This would prevent the slipping seen in the 'Around the legs' attachment. However, it was very difficult ot manuever these straps into place from a seated position, so we eliminated this option evenutally. </p>

                  <p class = "collage-title-text">A third attachment method we prototyped was a strap that wrapped around the user's back in addition to the two straps that wrapped around the legs. This design, however, pulled the block out of position when the user shifted their weight. Additionally, it was the most confusing configuration due to the number of straps. It was also difficult for the user to attach the behind-the-back strap, so for these reasons this design was also ultimately eliminated.</p>

        <p class = "header-text"><b>Preventing Slipping</b></p>
        <p class = "project-text">Having decided on a strap configuration, we still had an issue with the block slipping. Due to the shape of the block, any pressure from the user's legs would push the block forward until it was out of position. The foam material offered some friction, but not enough to prevent this slipping. Therefore, we decided to <b> prevent slipping by increasing the friction between the user's legs and the block with Plasti-Dip.</b> This solution provided a tackier contact point where the user's legs touched the block, increasing the friction and decreasing any slipping.</p>

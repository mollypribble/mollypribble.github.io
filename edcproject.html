        <p class = "project-text">Our project with the <a href = "https://www.evanston.coop" target = "_blank"><mark><em>Evanston Development Co-op (EDC)</em></mark></a>  involved creating a website for their On to 2022 campaign. EDC is a co-operative based on out of Evanston, IL that campaigns for the legalization of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in Chicago and across the country. ADUs, also commonly referred to as granny flats or coach houses, are basically separate residences on the same property as a larger single-family house. Historically, they have been outlawed by zoning ordinances and local governments, but the recently ADUs have gained popularity due to their many social, economic, and environmental  benefits. EDC needed a website that would be able to: <br><br> <b>1</b> - increase awareness of the legality of ADUs  <br> <b>2</b> -  promote education about the benefits of ADUs <br> <b>3</b> -  mobilize campaigners for the legalization of ADUs. <br></p>

        <p class = "project-text">After our initial client interviews, we created user personas and journeys for potential users of the EDC website. We wanted to make sure we were  providing relevant information and organizing it in a way that was accessible to the wide audience that EDC was promoting towards. When mapping these user journeys, we  focused on identifying who would be accessing this website, what their goals would be, and  what message EDC would  try to convey to each of them.</p>

We spent time brainstorming and discussing website architecture and information organization as well as styling, layout, and color. Our initial brainstorms started on paper and slowly increased in fidelity as we converged onto a final design to implement.</p>

      <p class = "header-text"><b>Promoting ADU Literacy</b></p>
      <p class = "project-text">A big part of EDC's On to 2022 Campaign was to dispelled common myths about ADUs and increase awareness of their benefits. To do this, we provided easy-to-digest information about what ADUs are and how they can improve the communities they are in on our What are  ADUs? page and on our FAQs page. Some common misconceptions include: <br><br><b> 1 </b> - ADUs make parking  harder to find by increasing population density. <br><br><b> 2 </b> - ADUs will decrease property value in the communities they are in.  <br><br><b> 3 </b> - ADUs are mainly used as vacation or short-term rentals.<br><br>These misconceptions are largely non-issues with ADUs. By increasing opportunities for affordable housing, it actually decreases the need for long-distance commuting by allowing people to live nearer to work  and commute via public transportation or by foot. Additionally, while ADUs do provide more affordable housing opportunities, they do not decrease property value. In fact, an ADU can actually be seen as an investment for many as the additional living space can increase property value and provide additional income as well. ADUs are also mostly used a permanent or long-term residences, often by members of the community who are looking to downsize or house an aging relative. We included statistics to convey this information is a variety of visual and written ways to our target audience. </p>
      <p  class  = "standout-text">According to a 2017 report out of the Terner Center at UC Berkley, 60% of ADUs in Portland and Vancouver were used as permanent residences, while just 12% were used as short-term rentals.</p>

        <p class = "project-text">An element we included to mobilize supporters of ADUs to take action was a contact form that put the  user in touch with EDC. This allows users to easily find out more information about ADU advocacy both in the Chicagoland area as well as across the  country. Many times potential ADU advocates may not know how to get involved, as ADUs are normally regulated on a local scale, and legality may change from municipality  to municipality. This form streamlines this process for ADU advocates by connecting them to an existing organizing that has lots of resources on how to campaign for ADUS, knows what the current legal status of ADUs in t he areas surrounding Chicago, and has established contacts with local policymakers involved in the ADU legalization effort.</p>

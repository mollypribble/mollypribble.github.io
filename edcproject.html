        <p class = "project-text">Our project with EDC involved creating a website for their On to 2022 campaign. EDC is a co-operative based on out of Evanston, IL that campaigns for the legalization of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in Chicago and across the country.</p>
        <p class = "project-text">The purpose of this project was to (1) promote education about the benefits of ADUs, (2) increase awareness of the legality of ADUs, and (3) mobilize campaigners for the legalization of ADUs.</p>

          <p class = "project-text"><b>Data Visualization of ADU Legality</b></p>
          <p class = "project-text">On this project, I lead the design and development of a data visualization feature that helps users quickly see how ADU-friendly certain states are. While EDC is based in Evanston, IL, our client wanted to not only  target residents of Chicagoland, but wanted to provide relevant information to people across the country. </p>
          <p class = "project-text">After some initial brainstorming and research, we came up with the idea for an interactive map that displayed different tiers of ADU-friendliness for each state  and would not only  provide quick access to national ADU guidelines, but would make this page more interactive and fun for the visitors.</p>
